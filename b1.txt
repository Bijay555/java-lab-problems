great men aren't born great they grow great. past can hurt but can either run from it or learn from it. real loss only possible when loss something more than love yourself. we used look up sky wonder at our place stars now we just look down worry about our place dirt. yesterday history tomorrow mystery, but today gift.that'swhy it called present. life moves pretty fast.if dont stop look around once while, could miss it. do or do not. there no try. when are good at something. donot do it for free. we all go little mad sometimes. happiness only real when it shared.
