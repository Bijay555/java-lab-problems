Great men aren't born great they grow great.
The past can hurt but you can either run from it or learn from it.
Real loss is only possible when you loss something more than you love yourself.
We used to look up in the sky and wonder at our place in the stars and now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.
Yesterday is a history and tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.That'swhy it is called present.
Life moves pretty fast.If you dont stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
Do or do not. There is no try.
When you are good at something. Donot do it for free.
We all go a little mad sometimes.
Happiness is only real when it is shared.
